As a young teenager he taught himself to ride dirt bikes and spent a lot of time riding dirt bike trails in Wisconsin. He attended Knox College in Galesburg, IL and received the Distinguishable Student Award for his life-saving research projects training dogs at the local animal shelter. During college, Roby also solidified his love of motorcycles and purchased his first street-legal motorcycle. After college, Roby worked for a few years at an animal shelter before going back to school and completing a Master’s Program in Animals and Public Policy at Tufts University. Roby then attended and graduated from DePaul University School of Law where he received an Excellence for the Future Award in Legal Analysis, Research, and Communication.</p></div>
