            <p>Roby was born and raised in Chicago. He started his legal education very young watching his father argue
              cases in the courtroom. As a young teenager he taught himself to ride dirt bikes and spent a lot of time
              riding dirt bike trails in Wisconsin. He attended Knox College in Galesburg, IL and received the
              Distinguishable Student Award for his life-saving research projects training dogs at the local animal
              shelter. During college, Roby also solidified his love of motorcycles and purchased his first street-legal
              motorcycle. After college, Roby worked for a few years at an animal shelter before going back to school
              and completing a Master&#8216;s Program in Animals and Public Policy at Tufts University. Roby then
              attended and
              graduated from DePaul University School of Law where he received an Excellence for the Future Award in
              Legal Analysis, Research, and Communication.</p>
